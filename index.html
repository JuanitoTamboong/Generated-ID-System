            <p>
                The ID Photo Resizing and Formatting System is designed to help users quickly generate properly formatted ID photos without manual editing. 
                Users can simply upload their ID picture, and the system will automatically adjust it to standard sizes such as 2x2, 1x1, passport size, or custom dimensions.

                This tool ensures that photos meet official ID requirements by auto-cropping, centering faces, adjusting backgrounds, and enhancing image quality. 
                Users can select their desired size, preview the output, and download the final image instantlyâ€”making it perfect for student IDs, employee badges, visas, and other official documents.
